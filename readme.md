2. PHP 7.4 (Apache handler)
3. MySQL 8
4. Symfony 4 LTS
5. RabbitMQ 3

## Setting up PROD environment
1.Clone this repository from GitHub.

2.Edit docker-compose-prod.yml and set necessary user/password for MySQL and RabbitMQ.

Note: Delete var/mysql-data folder if it is exist.

3.Edit env.prod and set necessary user/password for MySQL and RabbitMQ.

4.Build, start and install the docker images from your terminal:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml build
make start-prod
```

5.Make sure that you have installed migrations / messenger transports:
```bash
make migrate-no-test
make messenger-setup-transports
```

## Setting up STAGING environment
1.Clone this repository from GitHub.

Note: Delete var/mysql-data folder if it is exist.

2.Build, start and install the docker images from your terminal:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml build
make start-staging
```

3.Make sure that you have installed migrations / messenger transports:
```bash
make migrate-no-test
make messenger-setup-transports
```

## Setting up DEV environment
1.Clone this repository from GitHub.

2.Set another APP_SECRET for application in .env.prod and .env.staging files.

Note 1: You can get unique secret key for example [here](http://nux.net/secret).

Note 2: Do not use .env.local.php on dev and test environment (delete it if exist).

Note 3: Delete var/mysql-data folder if it is exist.

3.Add domain to local 'hosts' file:
```bash
127.0.0.1    localhost
```

4.Configure `/docker/dev/xdebug.ini` (optional):

- In case you need debug only requests with IDE KEY: PHPSTORM from frontend in your browser:
```bash
xdebug.remote_autostart = 0
```
Install locally in Firefox extension "Xdebug helper" and set in settings IDE KEY: PHPSTORM

- In case you need debug any request to an api (by default):

```bash
docker-compose build
make start
make composer-install

## Getting shell to container
After application will start (`make start`) and in order to get shell access inside symfony container you can run following command:
```bash
make ssh
```
Note 1: Please use next make commands in order to enter in other containers: `make ssh-supervisord`, `make ssh-mysql`, `make ssh-rabbitmq`.

Note 2: Please use `exit` command in order to return from container's shell to local shell.

## Building containers
In case you edited Dockerfile or other environment configuration you'll need to build containers again using next commands:
```bash
make stop
docker-compose build
make start
```
Note 1: Please use next command if you need to build staging environment `docker-compose -f docker-compose-staging.yml build` instead `docker-compose build`.

Note 2: Please use next command if you need to build prod environment `docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml build` instead `docker-compose build`.

## Start and stop environment

make stop
```
Note 1: For staging environment need to be used next make commands: `make start-staging`, `make stop-staging`.

## Working on your project
1. For new feature development, fork `develop` branch into a new branch with one of the two patterns:
    * `feature/{ticketNo}`
2. Commit often, and write descriptive commit messages, so its easier to follow steps taken when reviewing.
3. Push this branch to the repo and create pull request into `develop` to get feedback, with the format `feature/{ticketNo}` - "Short descriptive title of Jira task".
4. Iterate as needed.
5. Make sure that "All checks have passed" on CircleCI(or another one in case you are not using CircleCI) and status is green.
6. When PR is approved, it will be squashed & merged, into `develop` and later merged into `release/{No}` for deployment.
