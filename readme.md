## Setting up DEV environment
1. Set another APP_SECRET for application in .env.prod file.
    
    Note 1: You can get unique secret key for example [here](http://nux.net/secret).
    
    Note 2: Do not use .env.local.php on dev and test environment (delete it if exist).
2. Build and start the image from your terminal:
    ```
    docker-compose build
    make start
    make composer-install
    ```
3. Add domain to local 'hosts' file:

    ```
4. Make sure that you have installed migrations/fixtures:
    ```
    make migrate
    make fixtures
    ```
5. Configure Xdebug:
    - In case you need debug only requests from frontend in Firefox:
        * Edit /docker/dev/xdebug.ini:
        ```
        xdebug.remote_autostart = 0
        ```
        * Restart container
        * Install locally in Firefox extension "Xdebug helper" and set in settings IDE KEY: PHPSTORM
        * Have fun with debugging
    - In case you need debug any request to an api:
        * Edit /docker/dev/xdebug.ini:
        ```
        xdebug.remote_autostart = 1
        ```

## Working on your project
1. For new feature development, fork `develop` branch into a new branch with one of the two patterns:
    * `feature/{ticketNo}`
2. Commit often, and write descriptive commit messages, so its easier to follow steps taken when reviewing.
3. Push this branch to the repo and create pull request into `develop` to get feedback, with the format `feature/{ticketNo}` - Short descriptive title of Jira task".
4. Iterate as needed.
5. Make sure that "All checks have passed" on circleci and status is green.
6. When PR is approved, it will be squashed & merged, into `develop` and later merged into `release/{No}` for deployment.
